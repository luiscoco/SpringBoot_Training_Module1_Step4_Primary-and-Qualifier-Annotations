What is the main purpose of the @Value annotation in Spring?
a) To create new instances of beans
b) To inject property values from configuration files into beans
c) To specify the bean scope
d) To define the structure of a properties file
Answer: b) To inject property values from configuration files into beans
Explanation: The @Value annotation is used to inject property values from external configuration files into Spring beans, facilitating dynamic configuration. The other options do not accurately describe its purpose.

Why is externalizing configuration beneficial for the Flight Application?
a) It increases the complexity of the codebase
b) It makes it harder to modify application behavior
c) It allows for easier changes to the file path without modifying code
d) It eliminates the need for configuration files altogether
Answer: c) It allows for easier changes to the file path without modifying code
Explanation: By externalizing configuration, the application can change the file path easily without needing to modify the source code, enhancing flexibility and maintainability. The other options do not represent the benefits accurately.

What should you create to hold externalized configurations in a Spring application?
a) A settings.xml file
b) A config.json file
c) An application.properties file
d) A data.yaml file
Answer: c) An application.properties file
Explanation: The application.properties file is the standard file used in Spring applications to hold externalized configuration settings. The other file formats are not typically used for this purpose in Spring.

How do you retrieve a property value using the @Value annotation?
a) By specifying the property name directly in the code
b) By using the syntax ${property.name}
c) By creating a getter method for each property
d) By declaring the property in an XML file
Answer: b) By using the syntax ${property.name}
Explanation: To retrieve property values using @Value, you use the syntax ${property.name} where property.name corresponds to the key in the application.properties file. The other options do not reflect the correct method.

What is one of the primary benefits of using externalized configuration?
a) It complicates the deployment process
b) It allows for the use of multiple configuration files for different environments
c) It requires more lines of code for configuration
d) It eliminates the need for any configuration at all
Answer: b) It allows for the use of multiple configuration files for different environments
Explanation: Externalized configuration supports different properties files for different environments, enhancing flexibility in managing configurations. The other options misrepresent the benefits.

What should you do to inject a property using the @Value annotation in CSVDataLoader?
a) Modify the constructor to accept the property as a parameter
b) Use @Autowired with a default value
c) Annotate the field with @Value("${property.name}")
d) Use a static method to access the property
Answer: c) Annotate the field with @Value("${property.name}")
Explanation: To inject a property, you should annotate the field in the CSVDataLoader class with @Value, specifying the property key within the ${} syntax. The other options do not correctly describe how to inject properties.
