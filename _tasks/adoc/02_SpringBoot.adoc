== Converting to a Spring Boot Application with @SpringBootApplication Annotation

=== Spring Feature Description

Spring Boot simplifies the setup of Spring applications by providing auto-configuration and an embedded server. The `@SpringBootApplication` annotation combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan` annotations, streamlining the configuration process.

=== Why Do We Need It in Flight Application?

By converting to a Spring Boot application, we can streamline configuration, simplify dependency management, and prepare the application for future enhancements, such as adding RESTful APIs or web interfaces.

=== Refactoring Application

We will:

- Add Spring Boot dependencies to the project.
- Annotate the main application class with `@SpringBootApplication`.
- Utilize Spring Boot's auto-configuration and dependency management.

=== Update The Code

- **Modify FlightsApplication to Use Spring Boot**

Annotate the `FlightsApplication` class with `@SpringBootApplication`. Replace manual context initialization with `SpringApplication.run()`.

Define bean of type `CommandLineRunner` inside the `FlightsApplication` class to run code after the Spring context is initialized. Inject the necessary dependencies into the `CommandLineRunner` bean.

=== Benefits of Using @SpringBootApplication

- **Simplified Configuration**: Reduces boilerplate code and simplifies setup.
- **Auto-Configuration**: Automatically configures components based on classpath settings.
- **Embedded Server**: Allows running the application standalone without external servers.
- **Ease of Deployment**: Simplifies packaging and deployment processes.
